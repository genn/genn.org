<div style="margin-left: 10px; padding-left: 30px; border-left: 3px solid #000;">This post is really irregular. As I like to post long illustrated stories to this blog, short and interesting notes are usually posted to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/genn.osypenko">my facebook</a>. So I decided to cross post the most interesting of them for the pleasure of my blog readers. Hope you'll like that. The special thing is my facebook is in Russian while these posts, tagged with <a href="/mega/blah/crossposted">crossposted</a> tag will be in English. Yay! </div>
