I caught one post in the sea of the drafts I have here. There are 10s of them. Anyway, I've chosen one and publish it today because this morning twitter is overfilled with messages like "I want to sleep". I don't have a problem <a href="/mega/en/2008/5am/">waking up with a smile</a> (I don't use <a href="/mega/en/2008/gimme-lo-five/">don't use</a> alarms, imagine that ;). Anyway I sometimes think <a href="/mega/en/2009/its-wrong-to-get-up-early/">it's wrong to get up early</a>. But let's get back to the topic. Below is the remastered version of text comics I've <a href="http://deinde.livejournal.com/182137.html">sent to bo</a> one morning.<!--more-->

This strip can also be considered a Friday tribute to <a href="http://omaketheater.com/comics/">Friday 4Koma</a> which I like a lot.
