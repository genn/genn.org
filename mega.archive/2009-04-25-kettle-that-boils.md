I bought a new kettle today <a href="http://www.copco.com/store/site/product.cfm/id/E61E9EB8-475A-BAC0-5AC88A711E41331F/fid/E61E9EC8-475A-BAC0-54A45EFF084BB109.cfm">Copco Torino</a> (central on the photo) to replace the old one made in Czechoslovak and burnt like heretic. It's a miracle that I could find a pretty-looking kettle that suits my kitchen design. I was desperate about other kettles and was about buying electrical one (they got pretty designs). The sparkling circle on it's lid is whistler and the lid is opened by the gentle press on the front part of handle. I was proud to know that this water boiler without only a hint on spout is  <a href="http://www.copco.com/promo_colorblooms.cfm">2005 Housewares Design Award</a> winner.
