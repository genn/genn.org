I don't get excited drinking coffee. One cup is enough for me to fall asleep. That's why I wasn't drinking coffee that night. But I answered the questions of [Arsart](http://designcollector.net/) who was writing the big article about web design in Russia for [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/). I act as a bystander who's somehow involved in the Russian web design scene. The article that includes my interview is fun and interesting: [Showcase of Web Design in Russia](http://smashingmagazine.com/2009/10/17/global-web-design-russia/).

I'd like to tell you more but I am veeerrryy sleepy and see no way to wake as long as coffee is not the answer. So I'll stop right here. ;)
