How were things invented couple of ages ago? You tied key to kite, set under the apple tree and waited while physics did its work. Not the most laborious process. You just had not to mix up what to tie and where to sit. Inventions are much easier nowadays: google it, find it, [twitter](http://twitter.com/genn_org/) it and here's you fresh baked invention!

Nevertheless there are some freaks who glue keys to the hedgehogs, launch pines to the orbit, sit under different objects, clap the desolate falling tree in lonely rainforests with one hand and act even more meaningful trying to find something unique and interesting. So new and useful that everyone would say "ORLY!!!" and understand how the Universe is working. 

Such a perfect intro and it's in vain.
