My friend who doesn't start his blog just to make me unable to link to him is now a sectary of community where it's believed that people must eat iodine. Not pure iodine to prevent wounds inside the had but iodised salt. It helps to fill a person with necessary iodine amount. It's very important to have enough iodine in your body if you live in radiation affected places like Ukraine. Iodine also prevents kids from growing idiots. Doesn't help at 100% and gives a warranty but minimises some risks.

My friend is visiting the conference of that iodine-addicted missionaries about saving Ukraine. So I've created him a uniform, so he can spread the news that iodine and salt are good together!
