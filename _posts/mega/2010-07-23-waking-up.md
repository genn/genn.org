I caught one post in the sea of the drafts I have here. There are 10s of them. Anyway, I've chosen one and publish it today because this morning twitter is overfilled with messages like "I want to sleep". I don't have a problem [waking up with a smile](/mega/5am/) (I don't use [don't use](/mega/gimme-lo-five/) alarms, imagine that ;). Anyway I sometimes think [it's wrong to get up early](/mega/its-wrong-to-get-up-early/). But let's get back to the topic. Below is the remastered version of text comics I've [sent to bo](http://deinde.livejournal.com/182137.html) one morning.<!--more-->

This strip can also be considered a Friday tribute to [Friday 4Koma](http://omaketheater.com/comics/) which I like a lot.
