I made a pretty business card for [photographer](http://kovenkin.com/) with [QR code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code) on one side. It sounds like a good joke that you have to take pic of his card if you want him to contact you to take yours. I just feel like I don't want to right anything more, so I illustrated how it works if you have card, cell phone and app that recognizes QR codes on that phone:<!--more -->

I use [QR app](http://block5.com/iphone) on my iPhone to recognize QR codes. It helped me a bit on Sziget ;) You can practice in recognizing codes using any QR codes in this post. Here is one more with my contacts:
