{% figureinfo iTunes 8 and iTunes 9 on the right it's alright ;) %}



Slightly changed GUI elements setting distance between Mac OS X and its' competitors, who are in different ways get "inspired" looking at Mac OS X.  I hope that iTunes 9 GUI design let's us kinda spy through the keyhole and get info about how the next Mac OS X design would look like.

By the way, did you know how to turn the best mini player mode in iTunes? Use âŒ˜W keyboard shortcut. It just can't be more minimalistic!
