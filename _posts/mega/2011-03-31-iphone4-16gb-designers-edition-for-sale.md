As you may know I've broken the glass on my iPhone 4 16Gb that was bought in Great Britain and was never locked. After that it was replaced with brand new front glass and I broke the back glass. So the back part of my iPhone now looks pretty much like decorated with stained glass and doesn't cut the user because it's very cool glass that looks quite stylish. As the glass was broken by me one can be sure it is designer's edition of iPhone. As opposed to other designers I'll sell my edition much cheaper than iPhone 4 costs here in Kiev (even if you decide to replace the back glass the final price would be still lower than used iPhone). You are welcome to contact me on this matter.

And if you still vague if the back glass is so important here is a story for you I wrote this winter. Thanks to it you would be as sure as I am that iPhone is not just about the back glass but more about user experience and being and iPhone.<!--more-->


## Yet another story about [every detail that matters](/mega/alan-jobs/)

It's cold in here, must be winter — paraphrasing  pick up joke. I wear gloves already because I like wearing them and I don't like to have cold hands. This morning I was in a hurry going down the street and listening music using default headphones attached to my iPhone 4. In a rush I was in I felt an overwhelming need yo know what time it was. As I wear no watches because I have clock in a phone the first impulse was to take the phone out of the pocket, slow down and look at it. Not the sort of things you do in a rush. Almost not thinking about what I was doing I just squeezed mic on default headphones wire to turn on voice dial and yelled angrily: 'What time is it?' in Russian  Realizing what I was doing while asking the phone I expected 'i don't understand what you are asking better luck next time' tone but was surprised to hear 'The time is ten hours twenty four minutes'. The reply was in Russian too. Know what? That just brightened my morning!

I don't know if other phones have this option but know I expect my phone to answer any question I have. I'll start with: What's the answer to the question of life the universe and everything?
