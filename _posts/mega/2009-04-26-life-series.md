It's hard to believe but being addicted to series three years ago was a shame. Nowadays even in the night clubs you can hear someone discussing the latest House M.D. episode crying trying to be louder then music. I already [wrote](/mega/tv-cereals/) about my favourite series, and [not once]( http://mega.genn.org/en/2007/californication/). Looks like it's time to make a new list — the more series I watch, the more I adore.

About  couple of weeks ago I finished watching [Life series](http://nbc.com/Life). The plot is about offbeat detective Charlie Crews, who returns to the force after serving time in prison for a crime he didn't commit.  He gets from $5 to 50 millions for his silence. He also like fruits and Zen. Everything else is subject of watching ;) You'd better watch it in English, because only some episodes are translated and that translation is awful… [as usual](/mega/what-translation-foo/).

Looks like the 21st episode would be the last, but it was not the plot of the series that made me write this post. I was impressed by soundtracks during hunt on Russian mafia:  that were songs of [Tatu](http://genn.org/#/works/tatu) and Russian "rapper" Seryoga. Those who aren't afraid of spoilers or arent' going to watch series can push the play button on the top picture to see themselves how soundtracks work ;) Respect [nbc](http://nbc.com/)!
