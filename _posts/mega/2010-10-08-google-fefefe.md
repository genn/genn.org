As it's John Lennon's birthday today (actually Google failed even on that, announcing Lennon's birthday on 8th of October), Google made a perfect animated logo dedicated to it. Check it on [google.com](http://google.com/) in not so obvious way — you have to click the logo you've never clicked before and never new it was active. But Google is [always Google](http://mega.genn.org/en/blah/google/) — nothing can be done really perfect. Was it really so hard to make the background of video the same as the background of the whole page? Pay [more attention to details](/mega/alan-jobs/) already, you're not beta startup for years!

For all those, who think that it's the YouTube's way of creating problems I want to remind that YouTube is Google's. So even if the owner of the service can't make the service stop ruining videos, what should ordinary users do?
