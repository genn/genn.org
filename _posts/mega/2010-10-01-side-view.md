As MTS changed its logo a tiny bit (you can see that huge changes above), I'd like to remind about the post I wrote about their egg-logo some time ago: <a href="/mega/ru/identify-yourself/">Identify Yourself</a>. This logo in one of the resembling logos of another companies that are owned by the same holding or corporation. Would they change logos for them too? I highly doubt. And it's still red on red. I hope they would stop being ashamed of their logo and start calling egg the egg, not ellipsoid.
