I can hardly imagine what others feel but every birthday for me is like worldwide holiday. I smile to everyone and become a bit surprised that not every person I meet greets me. Some of them are even not smiling. So when my father's birthday happened I wanted him to feel like it is worldwide and made people who aren't acquainted with my father to frankly greet him with a smile. In order to achieve that result I place a picture (see the top of the post) to my Facebook and made a little description for it:

<i>Today is a perfect day!  The day my father was born. When I am asked to fill parents' occupations I always say 'The Headmaster of the Internet' because noone should know he is 'The Headmaster of the Universe'. I'll tell you a couple of facts about my father so you won't be unacquainted anymore and would greet him as a friend.</i><!--more-->

You can watch this post  [on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2137766676976) (if you can't see the post it's the good reason to [friend me there](http://www.facebook.com/genn.osypenko)) or read the facts here. I sorted them starting with the fact that was liked more than others:

<span style="font-size: 18px; color: #aaa;">17 likes</span>  My father is allergic to antiallergic drugs. When he was prescribed sedative pills he became quite nervous.

<span style="font-size: 18px; color: #aaa;">15 likes</span> My father is always the center of the company and is never importunate as his son sometimes is. When I was a child I asked my mom if I would joke like my father when I grew up.

<span style="font-size: 18px; color: #aaa;">15 likes</span> My father does everything perfect. He likes to plan everything and do it right. We joke about his first step that is to create originally scaled mockup.

<span style="font-size: 18px; color: #aaa;">15 likes</span> My father would never believe I am a grown up no matter how old he is.

<span style="font-size: 18px; color: #aaa;">14 likes</span> My father taught me to nail when I was little child. We spoiled the floor cover but told mom nothing.

<span style="font-size: 18px; color: #aaa;">13 likes</span> I don't name my father father. I address to him by his name "Valerchik" whack is short for "Valery" (unlike Valery you thought about its a male name ;) Some people are shocked by that and have different theories why it's so but the answer is simple and clear. We're just friends. When I was 5 years old my father punished me forbidding to call him other way then father. He had enough patience to wait for a couple of days and then offered me to call him by name again.

<span style="font-size: 18px; color: #aaa;">12 likes</span> My father is responsible that's why he spends a lot of time on his work and is very disappointed and nervous when something goes wrong. We try to keep him at home but he is so disobedient.

<span style="font-size: 18px; color: #aaa;">9 likes</span> My father adores beer.

After these facts there were tons of greeting from my friends, people I know and just good people. Some of them knew only me, some of them knew me and my [mom](http://www.facebook.com/margarit.margaritovich), but only in Facebook, and some even knew my father in person. When we gathered together at 6 p.m. to celebrate I gave him the ipad with the Facebook post opened so he could enjoy the greetings. That's way better then 50 cents card.
