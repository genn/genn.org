Here’s something I’ve been working for about three weeks. That thing I called applied infographics. After the 20th time I explained what I did to my friends and colleagues I decided it’s time to show the thing to the world.

It started when Daniel Kovzhun came up with idea of the mobile Geodesic Dome that could be assembled and disassembled easily. The use of this Dome is to cover some area (12m diameter circle) to make different outdoor events. The construction was awesome but the instructions weren’t. Every part of the Dome was marked with it’s number strictly representing the place in the big structure. There was no way to assemble or disassemble the Dome easily. So I was asked to come up with labeling of the parts (including even the names for them) and to create the instruction that would make the process as easy, as Lego.

{% sidenote Thanks to the patterns I’ve noticed the error in Dome structure description was found and eliminated. You can’t even imagine how proud I am %}

Turned out the project would be more exciting and friendly than it was expected. As Daniel started explaining me how the whole Dome thing works I’ve noticed some interconnections and regularities. With all that more then 300 parts to connect I suddenly realized everything was much easier than it seemed. But lets start from the very frightening beginning.

## Basics

Dome looks like dome (what a surprise) made of triangles connected with their apexes. Every apex is a Hub and triangle edges that connect Hubs are Struts.
