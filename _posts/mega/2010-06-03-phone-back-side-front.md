Hey, phone producing companies, place screen and buttons on one side of the cell phone and dynamic on the other. Is that so hard? Every year when summer starts to heat the plastic or glass phone screen starts to stick to your ear or cheek. While it's just uncomfortable with regular cell phones it makes touch screen phones (like iPhone and its brothers from other producers) unusable. You have to wipe the screen so it could feel you touch it again. Placing the dynamic on the other side of the phone solves that!



## Update

Now iHave iPhone 4 and see my iDeas iS useless at least for it. Both surfaces on both sides are glass, but this glass doesn't stick to your cheek and is not so much affected by sweat. So either you mess with placing screen on the other side, either you make normal glass that doesn't stick.
