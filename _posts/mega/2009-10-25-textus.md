It's hard to ignore inscriptions in latin [strolling Rome](/mega/in-rome/). You'll notice pretty serif fonts in capitals there and where. But these are just sentences that differ not so much from texts we got used too. You may notice that there are no U letters in them but that's all. When me and my girlfriend came to [Ara Pacis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ara_Pacis), we saw the whole wall of text — testament of the Roman emperor Augustus. We came there at night, so we could see Ara Pacis just through windows, but I wasn't. I was staring at testament feeling that something strange is about it. Sure it was strange — no punctuation marks and all capitals. Every word separated with dot like this • and sentences are separated with just a bit wider space after the dot. You can see that on pic.

There is a thought that nothing is new and everything repeats in ages. Looking at how people communicate in internet nowadays, I see the replica of that Augustan time style of communications. First of all, all letter are in one case, not capitals as in testament, but lowercase. Second, not punctuation marks — you won't deny it's common all over the internet now. Ok, we just have to start replacing the periods wider spaces and we'll live like in Roman Empire. I expect orgies! ;)
