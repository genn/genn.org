It's easy to imagine lifelike situation when two photos with pale pictures on them talk to each other:
— Hey, you've been on vacation. Haven't you tanned?
— I did but I was saved using <i>Safe for Web</i> after that!

I think that everyone met this problem when using <i>Safe for Web</i> — pics become lighter and kinda pale. Looks like someone mysterious used levels to adjust it.<!--more-->

I am happy to announce that this problem is solvable but not in a very obvious way. In <i>Safe for Web</i> dialog click on the arrow under the buttons on right panel and uncheck <i>Convert to sRGB</i> menu item.

That would do the trick!
