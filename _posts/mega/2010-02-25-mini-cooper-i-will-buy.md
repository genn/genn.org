It was a 5-years-long waiting for MINI to hear my thoughts (as <a href="http://mega.genn.org/en/2007/c1rca/">they did in c1rca</a>) and make the Cooper I'd buy. Not just buy but also adore, love, respect, be proud of and drive like I'm riding a dream. Here it is — coming soon <a href="http://mini.co.uk/">MINI Cooper Countryman</a>. Besides it's new design and perfect body it has normal amount of doors. MINI fans can blame me I don't feel the spirit, banish Countryman out of Cooper family — I don't care. I just want to ride this perfect <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/car-manufacturers/mini/7299739/MINI-Countryman-prices-announced.html">six-speed manual gear box</a> beauty!

Just because it's MINI, the ads are wonderful. I'll spoil the joy a bit offering you to watch Countryman ad prior to teaser of that car.<!--more-->

And here's MINI Countryman teaser. Pay attention to the camouflage that is usually used to hide specific details of new models from papparazi. Now it's a part of a new promotion:
