It was a 5-years-long waiting for MINI to hear my thoughts (as [they did in c1rca](/mega/c1rca/)) and make the Cooper I'd buy. Not just buy but also adore, love, respect, be proud of and drive like I'm riding a dream. Here it is — coming soon [MINI Cooper Countryman](http://mini.co.uk/). Besides it's new design and perfect body it has normal amount of doors. MINI fans can blame me I don't feel the spirit, banish Countryman out of Cooper family — I don't care. I just want to ride this perfect [six-speed manual gear box](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/car-manufacturers/mini/7299739/MINI-Countryman-prices-announced.html) beauty!

Just because it's MINI, the ads are wonderful. I'll spoil the joy a bit offering you to watch Countryman ad prior to teaser of that car.<!--more-->

And here's MINI Countryman teaser. Pay attention to the camouflage that is usually used to hide specific details of new models from papparazi. Now it's a part of a new promotion:

Those who consider Countryman is not MINI can enjoy my photo of old marvelous MINI [taken in Rome](http://www.flickr.com/photos/genn-org/sets/72157616518931530/):
