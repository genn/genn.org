Romantic story about the cat who loves mouse who hates world and everything is in pixels. I remember my 90's with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_World_(video_game)">Another World</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback:_The_Quest_for_Identity">Flashback</a> with their unique inimitable vector polygon graphics with no antialiasing. <i>Please Say Something</i> looks like not like ancestor, but something that reminds of these games intros and gameplay. Perfect story, perfect ideology, perfect characters. Also it somehow have something in common with scandinavian design and infographics. I am really impressed and consider it to be reborn or may be start of new trend in animation. Good job O'Reilly! <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/3388129">Have a look in HD</a>! It's worth it!
