{% figureinfo There are at least four dimensions in timetravel graph, so please have a look at Tokyo Subway map. It is known that a pixel of temporal graph is 5 time more complex then the whole Tokyo Subway map %}


Lotsa fiction stories tell us about unfortunate wretches who get trapped in past. Living in society where technological progress is evolving faster then I write this post, heroes of these books are totally unpractical to leave without cell phones, internet and inflatable women. Every of them starts with thinking: "Oh! I am from the future! I'll make a little tell-and-show for them!" and then discovers that he doesn't know a bit about fusion of atoms or about how the semiconductors work. He can't even explain what is Fermat theory about. So this know-nothing know-all becomes one of common people of that time and can rely on his powers and stamina only. Did that ring a bell? It happens every time. Know what? That story line sucks and has nothing to do with reality. Anatole France's "L'Île des Pingouins" is more realistic than that.<!--more-->

No it's not that I deny that those freaks in past couldn't use their knowledge to do something useful. I strongly deny that every person would do so. Let's not discuss the certain story but discuss the overall plot. Okay, it's me or you who's in the past. Long time before Christ. We know something about social relationships (everyone who has been in internet for last two or three years knows something about it) and can apply our knowledge to rearrange tribe's we got in work and even become headman in it. Communications won't be the problem, because everyone now (even me) draws better then the best artists back there did (compare genn.org and rock-painting). Furthermore, the idea of rolling the round objects never was so unique. People rolled beams or fat tribesmen but dragged other not round things that didn't roll. How much time would it take to our fellow to suggest using wheels? From 5 seconds to 24 hours depending on his IQ.

Okay, let's move further. Let's imagine we're in the middle ages. We all know or at least understand how steam-enginge works. Yes, not the best efficiency but working instead of people. Here come social relations again, that were forming at that time. The things we know about medicine would be useful too. It wasn't obvious that wound disinfection is important. There are bunch of examples.

And if we could get in the middle of the past century that would be the best luck! Cell phones, personal computers, handhelds, PR and ad technologies, drugs, sex, financial schemes, flights to space — the routine part is left for engineers but ideas matter much more.

The closer we get to current 2009, the more ideas we can find to offer for developing society. Thinking about the level of technologies we got today the incarnation doesn't look so sophisticated. What was so hard about making Twitter, Last.fm or MacBook Air? All of them started as ideas about doing something. Every invention started as a good idea: "Let's make black person president of US", "Let's stop using paper and publish our newspaper directly to internet for free", "Let's make a new search engine and displace Google, spending hundreds of millions to advertise" — hmm, this idea doesn't sound so good ;)

It's fun to embody something but sometimes smell as routine but it can't be done without ideas first. Oh, here and now we have even too much ideas. Yesterday I saw a pic of cat-girl in white t-shirt who was rubbing the cross with her belly and twined her tail around it. When would people think of this except now? ;)
