I don't get excited drinking coffee. One cup is enough for me to fall asleep. That's why I wasn't drinking coffee that night. But I answered the questions of <a href="http://designcollector.net/">Arsart</a> who was writing the big article about web design in Russia for <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a>. I act as a bystander who's somehow involved in the Russian web design scene. The article that includes my interview is fun and interesting: <a href="http://smashingmagazine.com/2009/10/17/global-web-design-russia/">Showcase of Web Design in Russia</a>.

I'd like to tell you more but I am veeerrryy sleepy and see no way to wake as long as coffee is not the answer. So I'll stop right here. ;)
