Our parliament decided to pass a law about censorship in internet. Though it's just a bill now it was voted for by 404 deputies (irony of fate, yeah ;) Briefly, they want internet service providers to log all the information about every user net activity. These logs can be used later to determine if user made something illegal. What is illegal isn't yet defined is supposed to be later. <!--more-->Using war against child pornography as a cover our government creates a country where you must live in fear â€” just in case. I <a href="http://genn-org.livejournal.com/90529.html">wrote</a> (in Russian) about it in my livejournal and together with Bo (her <a href="http://deinde.livejournal.com/176744.html">first post</a> on that in Russian) we were one of the initiators of what looks like wide spread protests all over the Ukrainian internet.

I am actually proud of the visual identity and slogans I made. And this post not just to inform you about the awful bill but also encourage to support us.
