Okay, iPhone OS 3.0 is out, broken, jailbroken, pwned, owned and other 1337 kittens stuff. <a href="http://mega.genn.org/2008/iphone/">I have iPhone</a> that is called Original or 2G (the one with aluminium back, I like it!). I like almost everything about it, especially after I activated Japanese keyboard to type ★ and ♥. It works good, it fell on the different surfaces and still works, even the screen is a little bit damaged and seems like my SIM card is stuck in this iPhone for ages. It suits all my macs and works with them verrrrry good.


## But!!

Every time I want to update something on my iPhone I have to burn all my belongings, curse my enemies, present all my goods left after fire to the poor and then start casting a spells involving words like "Pwnage", "Quick pwnage", "DFU", "Jailbrake" and others. Can anyone really differ one from the other if they are not side by side in the text and knows this words' meanings? That's not all! I have to remember to uncheck some checkboxes, so my iPhone's start logo won't look like pineapple and weird drawn Steve Jobs won't cry his LULZ at me while all that magic stuff with DFU. Isn't it too much for just maintaining a phone?

Hey, Cupertino, I know you're reading (or not). Guess what? I'm buying Pre or some thing like that, 'cause I am tired to live in fear that my iPhone would turn into a brick or pumpkin at midnight! And I prey that owner won't turn into a rat.
