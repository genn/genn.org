There are a bunch of places to place the logo: gently on a sleeve, endearingly on the back side under the collar, comfortably at the bottom in front but closer to the seam. Having tshirt with logo placed that way I could answer my friends' enviously admiring questions: "Where did I get this tshirt from? I've won it from Vitrum vitamins!
