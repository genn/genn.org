It still surprises me that difference between design and decoration is discussed nowadays. Decoration is considered to be the design and design is something noone knows about. Meaningless infographics with reflections and shadows is said to be good while normal readable chart is bad because of shadows and reflections lack. I came up with simple and easy explanation of the difference, using the potato crisps (chips) packages because everyone likes them.<!--more-->



## Decoration



{% figure /o_O/decoration-and-design/lays.jpg~Lays package, front %}


Here is very neat and sweet decorated Lays package. We can see it's Lays and it's Baked. No information about weight or best before, but the picture is awesome — that's decoration, not the design.



## Design



{% figure /o_O/decoration-and-design/design.jpg~Pingo Doce drinking water and potato crisps (chips) package back %}


As Pingo Doce is a private label  of Pingo Doce foodstores, those, who created the package thought about cashiers trying to catch little bar codes with those red rays in their scanners. That's why bar codes are long enough so any cashier could easily scan them even if part of the bar code is damaged. That's design.

Good design can be decorated quite wonderful, but good decoration would never make bad design work.
